# **THE REALITY HACKING MANUAL**

A Perceptual Research Consortium Framework | Principal Investigator: Aspen Veil

## **ABOUT THIS MANUAL**

The Reality Hacking Manual is a practical introduction to reality hacking and the Neuroweaver framework, a comprehensive system for conscious reality creation. This manual provides an overview of the theoretical underpinnings of the framework, as well as practical implementation systems for applying the Neuroweaver principles in everyday life.

## **ABOUT THE NEUROWEAVER FRAMEWORK**

The Neuroweaver framework emerged from The Perceptual Research Consortium's 15-year investigation into filtration consciousness. Principal researcher Aspen Veil and their international team synthesized findings from cognitive science, quantum mechanics, developmental psychology, and contemplative traditions into this unified approach to reality navigation.

The architectural structure was designed in collaboration with systems theorist Phillip Clapham, building upon foundational research commissioned by The MÃ¶bius Group in their 1974-1989 consciousness studies. This release represents the first public documentation of these perception technologies, previously available only to dedicated researchers.

The Consortium neither confirms nor denies connections to earlier perception experiments conducted at various research institutions throughout the 1970s-2020s. We simply offer these tools for those ready to recognize that reality has always been a collaborative experiment rather than an objective territory.

Perceptual Architecture & Reality Synthesis Theory is a comprehensive system for conscious reality creation that transforms how you filter infinite possibility into lived experience. Unlike conventional approaches focused solely on thinking, Neuroweaver operates across all six dimensions of perceptionâ€”physical, emotional, symbolic, cognitive, social, and consciousnessâ€”providing unprecedented agency in how you experience and create reality.

Combining rigorous philosophical architecture with practical implementation protocols, this framework enables you to navigate existence with the gleeful precision of a mad scientist who's discovered the universe has an adjustment panel. Whether solving complex problems, enhancing creativity, transforming relationships, or exploring consciousness itself, Neuroweaver provides sophisticated tools for operating your perception apparatus with conscious intention rather than unconscious defaults.

Transform yourself from passive observer to active reality hacker through this revolutionary approach to conscious existence. ðŸ§ªðŸ§ âœ¨

## **ABOUT THE PERCEPTUAL RESEARCH CONSORTIUM**

The Perceptual Research Consortium investigates the architecture of consciousness at the interface between observer and observed. Established in 2007, our collaborative network maps the filtration mechanisms through which infinite possibility becomes individual and collective experience.

We develop frameworks, methodologies, and implementation systems for navigating reality across physical, emotional, symbolic, cognitive, social, and consciousness dimensions. Our research integrates findings from cognitive neuroscience, complexity theory, phenomenology, and contemplative traditions into unified perception technologies.

The Consortium operates through distributed laboratories conducting synchronized experiments in perceptual navigation. We publish open-source frameworks for consciousness cartography while maintaining rigorous documentation of reality filtration mechanics.

Our current focusâ€”the Neuroweaver architectureâ€”represents the convergence of fifteen years of investigation into how perception shapes reality and how conscious filtration selection can transform human experience.

Neither purely academic institution nor conventional research organization, the PRC exists at the precise interface where rigorous analysis meets experimental practiceâ€”where the map-makers become simultaneous travelers in the territories they document.

*Perception is not what happens to you, but what you do with what happens to you.*
