## PERCEPTION LICENSE v1.0

This work is simultaneously:

1. Completely free for all conscious beings to implement
2. Subject to a cosmic royalty payable only in expanded awareness
3. Protected by the paradox that attempting to own these ideas reveals fundamental misunderstanding of them

By engaging with this material, you agree that:

- These ideas cannot be owned, only temporarily filtered
- All applications must increase rather than decrease perceptual sovereignty
- The only binding constraint is that no constraints are ultimately binding

The original filtersmith waives all rights while asserting that no rights existed to begin with, as these patterns emerged from infinity and are merely being momentarily structured through language.
