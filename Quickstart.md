## Welcome to the Neuroweaver Laboratory

My research has been acquired by the **Perceptual Research Consortium** (PRC), a non-profit organization dedicated to exploring the intersection of perception, consciousness, and reality. The PRC is committed to advancing our understanding of these complex topics through rigorous research, innovative frameworks, and collaborative exploration.

The updated Neuroweaver framework is now available under the auspices of the PRC, and I am thrilled to announce that I will be joining the organization as a researcher and collaborator. This partnership will allow us to expand our research efforts, develop new tools and resources, and engage with a broader community of researchers and practitioners.
